<h1>About</h1>

<p>The OpenActive API dashboard provides publishers and users with a tool to find and understand OpenActive data published by various providers.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Dashboard columns</h2>

<p>On the homepage you can find a table showing the various features of the each provider's API. Above the table you'll find a date and time which show how recently the datasets were updated. The dashboard should update every 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Columns, with explanations are as follows:</p>

<h4>Provider</h4>
<p>States the provider name and a link to the dataset information page.</p>

<h4>Endpoint</h4>
<p>Provides a link to the API endpoint and shows whether the endpoint is responding to requests.</p>

<h4>Uses paging spec?</h4>
<p>Indicates whether the dataset conforms to the <a href="https://www.openactive.io/realtime-paged-data-exchange/">Realtime Paged Data Exchange specification</a>.</p>

<h4>Uses opportunity model?</h4>
<p>Indicates whether the dataset conforms to the <a href="https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/">Opportunity Model specification</a>.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>If a dataset conforms to the two specifications above the dashboard will produce a summary.</p> 
<p>The summary is generated by walking through each page of a dataset endpoint, skipping to pages relevant to the past year, and extracting values from the location and activity fields. Each summary update is limited to 500 samples. Sampling is run once a day to ensure the summary is kept up to date.</p>

<p>Opening the summary modal shows: </p>
