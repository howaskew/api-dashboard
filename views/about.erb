<h1>About</h1>

<p>The OpenActive API dashboard provides publishers and users with a tool to find and understand OpenActive data published by various providers.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Dashboard columns</h2>

<p>On the homepage you can find a table showing the various features of the each provider's API. Above the table you'll find a date and time which show how recently the datasets were updated. The dashboard should update every 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Columns, with explanations are as follows:</p>

<h4>Provider</h4>
<p>States the provider name and a link to the dataset information page.</p>

<h4>Endpoint</h4>
<p>Provides a link to the API endpoint and shows whether the endpoint is responding to requests.</p>

<h4>Uses paging spec?</h4>
<p>Indicates whether the dataset conforms to the <a href="https://www.openactive.io/realtime-paged-data-exchange/">Realtime Paged Data Exchange specification</a>.</p>

<h4>Uses opportunity model?</h4>
<p>Indicates whether the dataset conforms to the <a href="https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/">Opportunity Model specification</a>.</p>

<h4>Includes coordinates?</h4>
<p>Indicates whether any latitude longitude coordinates were found for any of the items in the dataset.</p>

<h4>Issues</h4>
<p>Displays the number of Github issues relevant to the dataset. This also links to the datasets github issues page, where you can discuss problems or contribute suggestions about the dataset.</p>

<h4>Licence</h4>
<p>Shows and links to the licence which applies to the dataset.</p>

<h2>Dataset Summaries</h2>
<p>If a dataset conforms to the two specifications above the dashboard will produce a summary.</p> 

<p>The summary is generated by walking through each page of a dataset endpoint, skipping to pages relevant to the past year, and extracting values from the location and activity fields. The location coordinates are reverse geocoded with <a title="ONS Dataset: Local Authority Districts" href="http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/local-authority-districts-december-2016-generalised-clipped-boundaries-in-the-uk/" target="_blank">local authority boundaries</a>, producing a tally of where opportunities take place.</p>

<p>Each summary update is limited to 500 samples. Sampling is run once a day to ensure the summary is kept up to date.</p>

<p>Opening the summary modal shows: </p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm">
    <div style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-top:0.5em;">
    <h6>Top Activities</h6>
    <p>Reports the frequency with which activity names are used to tag opportunities in this feed.</p>
    <h6>Top Local Authorities</h6>
    <p>Describes the geographic coverage for this dataset, by identifying the local authorities within which the opportunities take place.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="col-sm">
    <aside style="border: 1px solid silver; background-color: #EEE; padding:0.5em; border-radius:4px;">
    <h6>Please note</h6>
    <p>The counts use sampled data so are not a reflection of total number of opportunities.</p>
    <p>The Top Local Authorities counts use sampled data that has been geo-referenced by the publisher. They are not a reflection of the total number of opportunities.</p>
