<h1>About the opportunity data dashboard</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.openactive.io/">OpenActive</a> is a community-led initiative using open data to help people get active.
    The opportunity data dashboard lists all of the openly licensed datasets and APIs published as part of the OpenActive initiative.
  </p>
  <p>
    Opportunity data is about where and when sport and physical activities happen. For example, when and where
    a yoga class or group run is taking place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the opportunity data feeds, you can harvest data about sporting and physical activities from across the UK.
    This data is made available for anyone to access, use, and share under an open licence. You are free to use the data
    to help build new products and services, for example to help people discover opportunities to be more physically
    active.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dashboard provides an overview of which datasets are available, which data publishers
    support <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/">the OpenActive standards</a> and
    short summaries of the standardised data.
  </p>

<h2>Dashboard overview</h2>

<p>On the homepage you can find a table showing the various features of the each provider's API. Above the table you'll find a date and time which show how recently the datasets were updated. The dashboard should update every 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Columns, with explanations are as follows:</p>

  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Column name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

        <td>
          Provider
        </td>
        <td>

        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Endpoint
        </td>
        <td>

        <td>
          Summary
        </td>
        <td>
          Summaries are available for those datasets that conform to the standard data model. The summary includes
          a list of activities frequently found in the list, as well as a geographical breakdown for those feeds
          that include co-ordinates.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Licence
        </td>

<h2>Dataset Summaries</h2>
<p>If a dataset conforms to the two specifications above the dashboard will produce a summary.</p> 

<p>The summary is generated by walking through each page of a dataset endpoint, skipping to pages relevant to the past year, and extracting values from the location and activity fields. The location coordinates are reverse geocoded with <a title="ONS Dataset: Local Authority Districts" href="http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/local-authority-districts-december-2016-generalised-clipped-boundaries-in-the-uk/" target="_blank">local authority boundaries</a>, producing a tally of where opportunities take place.</p>

<p>Each summary update is limited to 2000 samples. Sampling is run once a day to ensure the summary is kept up to date.</p>

<p>Opening the summary modal shows: </p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm">
    <div style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-top:0.5em;">
    <h6>Top Activities</h6>
    <p>Reports the frequency with which activity names are used to tag opportunities in this feed.</p>
    <h6>Top Local Authorities</h6>
    <p>Describes the geographic coverage for this dataset, by identifying the local authorities within which the opportunities take place.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="col-sm">
    <aside style="border: 1px solid silver; background-color: #EEE; padding:0.5em; border-radius:4px;">
    <h6>Please note</h6>
    <p>The counts use sampled data so are not a reflection of total number of opportunities.</p>
    <p>The Top Local Authorities counts use sampled data that has been geo-referenced by the publisher. They are not a reflection of the total number of opportunities.</p>
    </aside>
