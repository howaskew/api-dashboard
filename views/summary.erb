  <p>Please note:</p>

  <p>The Top Activity list reports the frequency with which activity names are used to tag opportunities in this feed. The counts use sampled data so are not a reflection of total number of opportunities.</p>

  <p>The Top Local Authorities list helps to describe the geographic coverage for this dataset, by identifying the local authorities within which the opportunities take place. The counts use sampled data that has been geo-referenced by the publisher. They are not a reflection of the total number of opportunities.</p>

  <p>This summary was generated by sampling <%= samples %> opportunities published since 2017.</p>
