# OpenActive Dashboard

A dashboard to support Openactive API users/publishers.

## Quick Run

If you have docker installed you can build and launch the API Dashboard with the `dockerize.sh` script. All you need to do is clone the repository and from the project directory run the following scripts:

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
2. `git clone https://github.com/howaskew/api-dashboard.git` Note - not the openactive repo
3. `cd api-dashboard`
4. `bundle install`
5. `docker build -t openactive/dashboard .`
6. `./dockerize.sh`

You can now see the dashboard at http://localhost:3000

## Getting started with development

The API Dashboard is built with [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com), a Ruby web application framework. The dashboard uses [Redis](https://redis.io) to store API calls. 

To manage versions of Ruby, use a utility like rbenv, rvm or chruby. 

Once you have the requisite ruby version, install gems using `bundle install`. Once installed you should be able to launch the application with the command `bundle exec rackup`. The application should be available at: `http://localhost:9292`.

For the application to work you will also need to have a redis server running. The application will try to connect to the default redis host and port (`127.0.0.1:6379`). Alternatively, you can specify the host and port with the environment variables `OA_REDIS_HOST` and `OA_REDIS_PORT`. NB the application reads these, and other environment variables in `config/environment.rb`. 

## Tests

The API Dashboard use the Rspec test suite. To run the tests install the testset gems with `bundle install`, and then run `bundle exec rspec`.

## Command Line Tools

### Metadata

There is a script you can run to update the dashboard metadata. To run: 

`bundle exec ./bin/update_metadata.rb`

Or on Heroku:

`heroku run bundle exec ./bin/update_metadata.rb`

This script checks if the metadata has been updated recently. If you want to force it to update, provide an `-f` flag, e.g.: 

`bundle exec ./bin/update_metadata.rb -f`

### Summary

There is a script you can run to update the dataset summaries. To run:

`bundle exec ./bin/update_summaries.rb`

Or on Heroku:

`heroku run bundle exec ./bin/update_summaries.rb`

This script pages through the data and saves the page where it stopped. Subsequent updates will pick up where it left off. 

If you want to build a summary sampling from the first page you can provide the `--restart` option to restart from the beginning. E.g.

`bundle exec ./bin/update_summaries.rb --restart`

If you want to clear the summary, but coninue from the last page, you can provide the `--last-page-restart` option e.g.

`bundle exec ./bin/update_summaries.rb --last-page-restart`
